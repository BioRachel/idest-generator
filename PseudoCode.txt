User clicks on a button
  - React.Component stores this as prop and keeps track of it
  - This component needs to keep track of multiple props:

	- Major runes currently selected (& number)
	- Intermediate runes currently selected (& number)
	- Minor runes currently selected (& number)

 - This component also needs to have some functions

	- Based on the number and types of runes selected, get another react component to render a rune format
	- Pass that react component the right runes to render in the spaces as props.
	- Check that no more than x major, y intermediate or z minor runes are selected and if so, do not store this as a prop and tell the user that a maximum number of runes is allowed.
